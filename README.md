## This is my backend to the frontend app

This is my first excursion in Golang after hearing its efficiency in building API and it was very faster than I expect ed.
The database I used was Postgres.


## Running the server
```bash
# I seperated the modules so it can be easily debugged so we need to compile and run all modules
  go run .

```
